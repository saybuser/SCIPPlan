  SCIPPlan [1,2,3] is a SCIP-based [4] hybrid planner for
  domains with i) mixed (i.e., real and/or discrete valued)
  state and action spaces, ii) nonlinear state transitions
  that are functions of time, and iii) general reward
  functions. SCIPPlan iteratively i) finds violated
  constraints (i.e., zero-crossings) by simulating the state
  transitions, and ii) adds the violated (symbolic)
  constraints back to its underlying optimisation model,
  until a valid plan is found.
